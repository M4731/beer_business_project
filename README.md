# beer_business_project

This repository is representing an university project.<br/>
The point of the project is making a database that represents a beer business. <br/>
  - The company buys beer directly from producers and it sells it to various merchants at a higher price. <br/>
  - The company also produces food. <br/>
  - The merchants can buy food and beer and every transaction is made using a contract. <br/>
  - There are many types of beer. <br/>
  - Every beer has a rating. <br/>
  - Every beer-maker is situated somewhere in a country. <br/>
  - There's a table that contains good beer-food combinations. <br/>
 
 The project contains: <br/>
  - An sql file showing how I created the database using simple sql commands. <br/>
  - An sql file that contains 2 packages <br/>
    - one package contains functions such as :<br/>
      - showing every food that represents a good combination for a beer that is produced in a place introduced from the keyboard and returning their number <br/>
      - showing every beer, type and price bought by every merchant <br/>
      - the profit that is made in a month by a certain beer <br/>
      - all the useful information regarding the demand of a certain merchant. <br/>
    - the other package contains functions that show the medium rating for everything, for exemple: the beer from a specific location or the beer of a specific type
  - An sql file that contains the triggers used in the project. <br/> 
  - Two pdf files that contain the CD and the ERD of the database.

Here's an image showing how the final database model looks like:
